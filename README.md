## Proposal 
The goal of this progect is to start learning how to process small RNAseq data, specifically looking for piRNAs. I want to learn and gain pracitce with quality checks, trimming, and mapping/alignment.

I will be using the small dataset I currently have, with three samples each having paired end reads (for a total of six files.) My goal, however, is to make scripts that I can use for future sequence data when I recieve it.
