## Proposal 
The goal of this progect is to start learning how to process small RNAseq data, specifically looking for piRNAs. I want to learn and gain pracitce with quality checks, trimming, and mapping/alignment.

I will be using the small dataset I currently have, with three samples each having paired end reads (for a total of six files.) My goal, however, is to make scripts that I can use for future sequence data when I recieve it. 

This mini project will directly help me in my research, as my goal is to have a chapter dedicated to this piRNA seq data. I currently have very little experience in bioinformatics, so this project will help me get started and learn in a practical hands-on way. Additionally, I am a major fan of effiency and automation, so I'm also very eager and excited to learn the full power of bioinformatic skills. "You don't know what you don't know," so I'm very interested to learn what exactly I dont know, and things I never would have thought I could do!

### Technical Aspects
how will you structure and run your scripts, what do you think you will need separate scripts for, which external programs / bioinformatics tools will you use, and how will you structure your results?



Areas of uncertainty for me are currently how to trim for piRNAs, and how to map them. We have not covered this in class, and additionally as we have spoken in person, mapping piRNAs specifically is more complicated than it sounds. For the purposes of this project, however, a simple genome mapping will hopefully suffice, though I am unsure of how to do this currently.
